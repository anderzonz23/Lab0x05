# Java Big Integer Arithmetic

These algorithms produce big integers (http://wiki.compsci.ca/index.php?title=Java_Big_Integers) which are basically
numbers that are so large, they cannot be stored in any everyday variable.
The algorithms then produce calculations on those integers such as multiplication, exponentiation, matrix multiplication, etc.
Due to the resulting numbers being so large, some output will p rint out the first 5 and the last 5 digits of the numbers.
